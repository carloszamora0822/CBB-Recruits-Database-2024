⭐️ This project builds on the previous Recruit class by developing a RecruitDB class in C++ that manages a vector of Recruit objects. 
💡 It includes methods for reading and writing recruit data from text files, as well as search functions to filter recruits based on various attributes, such as location and performance stats. 
✨ The goal is to provide an efficient system for handling and querying the top 100 college basketball recruits, as reported by ESPN.
